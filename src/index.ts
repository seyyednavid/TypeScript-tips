//ReExporting
// import {Circle} from './shapes/Circle';
// import {Square} from './shapes/Square';

// sometimes we have lots of shapes , so it is not a good solution
// go to shapes folder, change shape.ts file to index.ts
//Add shapes into index.ts in shapes folder and again export them
import {Circle,Square} from './shapes/index'
